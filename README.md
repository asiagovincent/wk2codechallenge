g# Voting for the Cutest Animal - Web Application

## Introduction

This project is a simple web application that allows users to vote for the cutest animal among a list of options. It is built using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and JSON Server to store and retrieve the voting data.

## Features

- Users can view a list of animals to vote on.
- Users can click on their favorite animal to vote for it.
- The voting data is stored in a JSON file on a server using JSON Server.
- Users can see the current vote count for each animal.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of the web page.
- JavaScript: Provides the interactivity and handles user voting.
- CSS: Used for styling and making the web page visually appealing.
- JSON Server: Used to store and retrieve voting data in JSON format.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   
   git clone <repository_url>
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
   cd cutest-animal-voting
   

3. Install JSON Server:

   
   npm install -g json-server
   

4. Start the JSON Server to mock the backend:

   
   json-server --watch db.json
   

5. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How It Works

- When you open the web page, you will see a list of animals to vote for.
- Click on the animal you find the cutest, and your vote will be recorded.
- You can see the current vote count for each animal on the page.
- The voting data is stored in the `db.json` file on the JSON Server.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the web page structure.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles user interactions and voting.
- `db.json`: The JSON file used to store voting data.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication to prevent multiple votes from the same user.
- Add more animals to the voting list.
- Create a leaderboard to display the ranking of animals based on votes.
